# Youcube Client
This is a fork from https://github.com/CC-YouCube/client

# Server info
The server this fork provides doesnt support video convert to CC. As far im aware the package to convert vids for CC is not available for ubuntu, which is the OS this server runs on. You wanna use this server anyway? Always make sure to run --nv as argument.

```
youcube --nv
```

Now to install this fork of Youcube, run the following command on your CC computer:

```
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mentimjojo/yc-client-fork/main/installer.lua
```

# Disclaimer
This server was created because of an outage of the main servers, and just for funsies. (We software devs like to play around ;p) If this server is down or unreachable, you can make an issue ticket, but usage is at your own risk :)
